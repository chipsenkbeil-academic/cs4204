This uses the vertex shader to move the vertices based on a sin curve based
on time and that results in a ripple-like effect. Furthermore, this uses
the fragment shader to map the textures to the ripple in such a ways that
the environment is mapped onto the water's surface and the leaf texture
is mapped on top of the environment.
