How to compile:
Simply type make when inside the directory containing my files.
It produces a program called "prog" that can be executed.

Files:
main.cpp      (The main source file)
camera.h      (The camera header file)
camera.cpp    (The camera source file)
robot.h       (The robot header file)
robot.cpp     (The robot source file)

Information:
Starts out in normal mode where clicking and dragging the mouse rotates
the robot and the floor beneath the robot. The angles are locked to prevent
too much rotation up or down and also lock if spun in one direction
too much.

To change into other modes, right-click to access the menu. The options
available include normal mode (rotation), zoom mode (click and drag up and
down to zoom in and out), pan mode (click and drag left and right to pan
left and right), as well as modes for each body part to be able to rotate
each piece of the robot.

Keep in mind that I designed my panning such that after panning, rotating
will rotate the robot rather than the new location of the camera (I wasn't
sure what was required). This can be changed back really quickly in the
camera.cpp file to rotate about the camera location at all times, but I
wasn't sure what the requirement for rotation after panning was.

Furthermore, Dr. Cao stated in class that he expects us to make realistic
body poses in the future, but not for this assignment; so, the robot in
this assignment can bend any body part in any direction.
