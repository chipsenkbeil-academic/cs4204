* I used the C from "Chip" since that is what I go by.

How to build: (outputs assignment1 program and uses GLUT and GL libraries)
g++ -o assignment1 assignment1.cpp -lglut -lGL

How to run:
If within the directory containing the program, type './assignment1' without quotes.

What it does:
Renders a black figure wielding a black spear.
The figure has yellow eyes and cheap goggles that are yellow.
There is a yellow 'C' on the chest of the figure.
The black figure is in front of a white canvas that is surrounded by a red border.

List of where I used types:
GL_POINTS was used for the eyes.
GL_TRIANGLES was used for the tip of the spear.
GL_TRIANGLE_FAN was used for the left arm.
GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP was used for the right arm.
GL_QUADS was used for the legs.
GL_QUAD_STRIP was used for the face.
GL_LINE_LOOP was used for the square around the eyes (supposed to be lab goggles).
GL_POLYGON was used for the body.
GL_LINES was used for the spear pole.
GL_LINE_STRIP was used for the letter 'C' on the body.

glColor was used for the white center QUAD that contains the ninja with spear
along with the black and yellow colors used.

glPointSize was used on the eyes.

glLineWidth was used on the spear pole.
